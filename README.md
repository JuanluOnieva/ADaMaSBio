# ADaMaSBio: Adviser of Database Management System with Biological Databases

The aim of this proyect is to understand how work different types of Database Management System. We have selected one biological 
database; ChEBI. Then, we have chosen some DBMS: MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, MongoDB, existDB and Cassandra. 

First of all, we have download the corresponding file with the information of ChEBI and then we have imported it in each DBMS. 
Moreover, we have created different version in order to compare the speed of the DBMS with some optimization.

Finally, we have developed an app wich is able to connect with each DBMS and compute the time that takes the corresponding query.
